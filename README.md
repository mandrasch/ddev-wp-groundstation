# DDEV pull-wp

‚ö†Ô∏è Status: Experimental, use at own risk üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Scared a wordpress updates will break your old site? Want to play around with your wordpress site locally? DDEV pull-wp contains custom DDEV commands for pulling a live website to your local machine with just a single command (at least, this is the goal ;-)). 

## Prerequisites

- [DDEV](https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/) installed on your local machine
- [updraftplus premium](https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftplus-premium/) license <br>
  (or [updraftplus CLI](https://updraftplus.com/shop/wp-cli/) and [updraftplus Migrator](https://updraftplus.com/migrator/) license)
- SSH and rsync on remote server/webspace (live website)

## Install / Setup

1. **Clone this repository, open folder in terminal**

2. **Install fresh wordpress locally (installs updraft automatically)**

    ```shell
    ddev install-wp
    ```

    (This command will automatically install wordpress and activate the .zip file need to activate updraftplus for addons (See: https://updraftplus.com/support/installing-updraftplus-premium-your-add-on/). At the end of the installation, you will be prompted for an admin password.)

3. **Login into local wordpress**

    Login to https://pull-wp.ddev.site/wp-admin/ with user "admin" and your chosen password.
    
    [Use `ddev launch` to open the local site directly in browser]

4. **Activate updraftplus CLI and Migrator add-on ($)** 

    Activate paid license for updraftplus CLI and Migrator / premium in updraftplus dashboard with updraftplus account:

    https://pull-wp.ddev.site/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=updraftplus

    ![Screenshot updraftplus dashboard - CLI and Migrator addon successful activated](screenshot_updraftplus_activated.png)

    (See: https://updraftplus.com/support/installing-updraftplus-premium-your-add-on/)

## Pull a remote site

1. **Install updraftplus (free) on remote wordpress site**

    On the remote site it's best to use the updraftplus .zip file as well from here: https://updraftplus.com/support/installing-updraftplus-premium-your-add-on/ - but you don't have to activate/connect anything. Free version is enough.

2. **Create backup on remote site**

    ![Screenshot updraftplus dashboard - Backup screen](screenshot_updraftplus_backup_now.png)
  
    Just create a backup with "Backup now" in the Wordpress Dashboard of your live website.

3. **Pull remote site backup and restore(migrate) it**

    Now we can pull the backup from the live website to our local site. The ssh username and host is needed as well as the path where wordpress is installed on the remote webspace.
  
    ```shell
    ddev pull-wp sshusername@host.xyz /html/wordpress
    ```
    
    (This command connects to the remote live website via SSH, rsync's the backup files to local DDEV, restores it with help of updraftplus Migrator and CLI. You need to provide SSH information and path to wordpress installation on remote server.)

4. **Open and test updates locally**

    Open `https://pull-wp.ddev.site` to see the migrated site which now runs on your local machine.
    
    The local login credentials are replaced by the credentials of the live website. You can now test a bigger wordpress update in peace, without breaking the live website.
     
    [A good practice could be to use tools like Disable Emails, WP Debug Bar, etc.]
    
    Activate debug log and install plugin Debug bar e.g.:
    
    ```shell
    ddev exec wp config set WP_DEBUG true --raw --path=wordpress
    ddev exec wp config set WP_DEBUG_LOG true --raw --path=wordpress
    ddev exec wp config set WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY false --raw --path=wordpress
    ddev exec wp plugin install debug-bar --activate --path=wordpress
    ```

5. **Run updates on live website**

    If the update works locally, you can just run updates on your live site as well. 

## Reset

    <This part is work in progress>
    
1. **Reactivate CLI and Migrator addon on local DDEV**
    
    After a restore process you need to activate the updraftplus CLI again in WP dashboard unfortunately. Otherwise you'll get "Error: 'updraftplus' is not a registered wp command". It is helpful to have connected your live website with your updraft credentials as well, otherwise you'll need to re-enter them & activate the addons again. (TODO: Is there a workaround for this?)

2. **Delete transferred backups**

    ```shell
    ddev delete-backups
    ```
    
3. **Start with ddev pull-wp again**

## Usage scenarios

1. ü§ñ CLI local <-> free updraftplus on remote site

    In this mode you create the backup on your remote site with the free updraftplus using the WP dashboard. Afterwards you can sync it to your local machine via the local WPCLI addon and Migrator addon (both $) of updraftplus activated on your local machine.

2. ü§ñ CLI local <-> CLI remote ü§ñ 
    
    You'll need activated premium (or addon licenses) on local and remote machine(s) for updraftplus. 
    
    In CLI<->CLI (commandline-to-commandline) mode you can also create backups on remote site from your local machine, no need to visit the WP dashboard of your remote site. You can also get the <nonce>-identifier for the latest backup, which saves time syncing. 
  
## Advanced

### Local PHP/MySQL version

See .ddev/config.yaml to change the local docker enviroment to be similiar to your remote webspace/server. You can also use nginx instead of apache.

### Working with git?

If you have a theme checked out with git on remote website, this will be transferred to the local enviroment. Updratfplus does not delete .git folders while migration.

### Forgot password?

Run following command:

```shell
ddev exec wp user update admin --prompt=user_pass --path=wordpress/
```

### Symlink plugin/themes in fresh wp

Beware: Experimental

1. Clone a theme or plugin via git into symlinked-themes/ or symlinked-plugins/

2. Setup symlink

This will delete wp-content/themes/mychild-theme and replace it with symlink:

```shell
ddev setup-symlink theme mychild-theme
```

See ".ddev/commands/web/setup-symlink" for details.

### Full/hard reset
  
    Drop database datables and remove wordpress/-directory:
    
    ```shell
    ddev delete-wp
    ```
    If you need to remove other non-tracked files:
    (Caution: also deletes ignored files + symlinked-/ folders)
    
    ```shell
    git clean -fdx
    ```
    Delete complete DDEV containers:
    
    ```shell
    ddev delete -O
    ```
    
    If you made changes to DDEV files from this git repo, which you want to delete: 
    
    ```
    git reset --hard`
    ```


## Challenges

1. Updraftplus configuration is overwritten on restore, activated CLI and Migrator plugin need to be activated again (this is kind of annoying if you want to pull the next website)
